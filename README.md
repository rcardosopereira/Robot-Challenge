*pip install robotframework<p>*
*pip install robotframework-seleniumlibrary*


## Step 5: Clone the Project Repository
git clone git@github.com:rcardosopereira/Robot-Challenge.git

Navigate to the project directory.<p>
cd your_project

Run the test cases using the following command:

*robot name_of_file.robot<p>*
The above command will execute all the test cases located in the test_cases directory.

That's it! You have now set up the project with the required versions of Google Chrome, ChromeDriver, Python, SeleniumLibrary, and Robot Framework. You can now run your test cases successfully.
